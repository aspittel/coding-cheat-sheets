# Graphing
Graphs are non-linear data structures that do not necessarily follow a numerical order. Graphs are similar to trees but with essentially no rules. A tree is a graph, but most graphs are not trees. 


Graphs have nodes (also called verticies) and edges. The node holds the data and then the edges point to related nodes. There are two types of edges: directed and undirected. Directed edges point in a direction whereas undirected edges point both ways. 

* Good examples of graphs are Facebook friends, Twitter following (which would be directed), or a map of Metro stops.

* There are many ways to store a graph data structure. You can use pointers and nodes, or you could use an adjacency list or matrix.

* A degree is how many edges a given vertex has. 

* An Euler path visits each edge just once. A graph must have either zero or two verticies with an odd degree to have an euler path. 

* A cycle is a circle mad of edges.

* Both edges and nodes can be weighted.
