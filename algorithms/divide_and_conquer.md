# Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer is "an algorithm design paradigm that is based on multi-branch recursion. It takes a larger problem and breaks it into 2+ sub-problems" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm)). [Merge soring](https://github.com/aspittel/coding_cheat_sheets/blob/master/sorting/mergesort.md) and some fibonacci algorithms are implementations of the divide and conquer algorithm.
